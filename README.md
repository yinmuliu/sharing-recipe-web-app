# EasyPeasy

EasyPeasy is an online community for sharing quick and easy recipes. This is my first full-stack web application inspired by some recipe apps I used, such as Cookpad, Tasty and VegKit. I mocked some of their features for practice purpose, and gave it a minimalist look at the front end.

## Planning and Development

Initial planning for a CRUD web app:

![Planning.png](/public/README-image/Planning.png)

To help myself keep track of the project scale and development, I set up an excel table based on CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Destroy) and map the URL, EJS files and Mongoose methods according to each functionality. During implementation, I was able to stick to this planning and add a few more functionality to it - user signup, login/logout and individual userâ€™s page.

## Improvement Ideas

1. Add a search functionality - search recipes according to name, creator and keywords in ingredients!
2. Add sorting functionality to sort according to cook time - best function for busy people!
3. Allow user to upload videos: first need to be on Youtube, then use the url entered by user to display video on recipe show page
4. Add a review session for each recipe

## Acknowledgement

Thanks to Dido, Mandy and Hugh @General Assembly for pointing me to the right directions and resources when I get stuck. A special thank to Yixuan for introducing more git tools to me, now I am able to better manage my project using git branches, merge, issues and the project kanban. 

Thanks to my inspiration apps, sites and the recipes they provided: Cookpad, Tasty, VegKit, Woolworth Recipes.
